/**
 * Better Auth — the single authentication authority for this application.
 *
 * This replaced a hand-rolled HS256 JWT (`jose`) that carried the whole user,
 * their roles and their permissions inside the cookie. Two properties of that
 * design are worth remembering, because moving to Better Auth is what fixes
 * them:
 *
 *   - A JWT is a bearer claim, not a lookup. Roles and permissions were frozen
 *     into the token at sign-in, so revoking a role left the old token granting
 *     it for up to 30 days. Better Auth stores a session row and resolves RBAC
 *     per request, so a revoked role takes effect on the next request.
 *   - There was no way to end a session server-side. Now there is a row to
 *     delete.
 *
 * ── The user table is the EXISTING one ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `roles`, `user_roles`, `resource_permissions`, `ds_user_roles` and the audit
 * log all key on `users.id`. Letting Better Auth create its own `user` table
 * would have orphaned every one of them, so the `user` model is mapped onto
 * `users` instead and only the columns Better Auth needs were added. RBAC is
 * untouched by this migration, which is the point.
 *
 * ── Passwords stay bcrypt ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Better Auth hashes with scrypt by default. Every existing password in this
 * installation is a bcrypt hash, and there is no way to convert one without the
 * plaintext — so the `hash`/`verify` hooks below keep bcryptjs as the algorithm.
 * Existing users keep signing in with the passwords they have. Swapping to
 * scrypt later means a rehash-on-next-sign-in shim, not a config change.
