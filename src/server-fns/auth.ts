/**
 * Sign out.
 *
 * Delegated to Better Auth rather than expiring a cookie by name, and that is
 * the whole point: `signOut` DELETES THE SESSION ROW as well as clearing the
 * cookie. Clearing the cookie alone would leave a live session in the database
 * that any copy of the token still opens.
 *
 * The previous implementation wrote `session_token=; Max-Age=0` — the name of
 * the cookie this application used before Better Auth. Against the real cookie
 * (`ers.session_token`) that expires nothing: the browser keeps its session,
 * the row stays in the database, and the user is redirected to /login while
 * still signed in. Navigating back would have let them straight in.
