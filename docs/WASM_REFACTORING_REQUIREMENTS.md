## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the requirements for refactoring the Enterprise Reporting and Dashboard System from a **server-side SQL execution architecture** to a **WASM-centric, client-side processing architecture**. The goal is to achieve instant in-browser filtering, aggregation, and visualization on millions of rows without server round trips — delivering a Kepler-like interactive experience for tables, charts, and maps.

### 1.2 Target Stack

| Layer | Current Technology | Target Technology | License |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Query Engine | Server-side SQLite via Knex.js | **DuckDB-Wasm** (in-browser SQL) | MIT |
| Data Grid | TanStack Table + virtual scroll | **Glide Data Grid** (canvas-based) | MIT |
| Charts | Recharts (SVG-based) | **Apache ECharts** (canvas-based) | Apache-2.0 |
| Data Format | JSON over HTTP | **Apache Arrow / Parquet** | Apache-2.0 |
| Transport | REST API → JSON | Arrow IPC / Parquet files over HTTP | Apache-2.0 |

### 1.3 Key Value Proposition

- **Instant interactions**: Filters, aggregations, and sorts execute locally in DuckDB-Wasm — no server round trips
- **Millions of rows**: DuckDB's columnar engine + Arrow format handle large datasets efficiently in-browser
- **Rich visualizations**: ECharts provides maps, heatmaps, tree charts, graph charts, and 40+ chart types
- **Offline capability**: Once data is loaded, the browser can operate independently of the server
- **Reduced server load**: Server becomes a data provider (Parquet/Arrow files); computation moves to client

---

## 2. Current System Analysis

### 2.1 Architecture Overview

The current system is a **Next.js 14 App Router** application using **Bun runtime** with a classic server-centric data flow:

```
[Browser] → REST API → [Next.js Server] → Knex.js → [SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL/MSSQL/Oracle]
                                          ↓
                                    JSON Response
                                          ↓
                                [Browser] → TanStack Table / Recharts
```

**Every data operation** (filter, sort, paginate, aggregate) requires a server round trip.

### 2.2 Current Dependencies Being Replaced

| Package | Current Role | Reason for Replacement |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| `recharts@2.12.7` | SVG-based charting (8 types: bar, line, area, pie, scatter, column, doughnut, composed) | Limited chart types, SVG performance degrades with large datasets, no maps/heatmaps/trees |
| `@tanstack/react-table@8.20.5` | Table rendering with virtual scrolling | Not canvas-based; DOM-based virtualization has limits at millions of rows |
| `@tanstack/react-virtual@3.10.7` | Row virtualization for QueryResults | Replaced by Glide's native canvas virtualization |
| `react-grid-layout@1.4.4` | Dashboard grid layout | **Retained** — orthogonal to data rendering concerns |
| `knex@3.1.0` | Server-side SQL query builder | **Retained for config DB** — DuckDB-Wasm handles analytical queries client-side |
| `better-sqlite3@11.3.0` | Server-side SQLite access | **Retained for config DB** — stores metadata, users, roles, permissions |
| `node-sql-parser@5.4.0` | SQL validation/AST parsing | Partially replaced — DuckDB-Wasm has its own SQL parser; server-side validation still needed for config queries |
| `sql-formatter@15.4.2` | SQL formatting | **Retained** — still useful for display formatting |

### 2.3 Current Dependencies Being Retained

| Package | Role | Why Retained |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `next@14.2.11` | App framework | Core framework — no change |
| `next-auth@5.0.0-beta.21` | Authentication | Auth layer is orthogonal to data processing |
| `@tanstack/react-query@5.56.2` | Data fetching/caching | Still useful for API calls, metadata fetching, caching |
| `@tanstack/react-form@1.28.3` | Form management | Forms unchanged |
| `@hookform/resolvers@3.9.0` + `react-hook-form@7.53.0` | Form validation | Forms unchanged |
| `@monaco-editor/react@4.6.0` | SQL editor | **Enhanced** — will target DuckDB SQL dialect |
| `zod@3.23.8` | Schema validation | General utility — retained |
| `bullmq@5.12.15` + `ioredis@5.4.1` | Background job processing | Server-side jobs still needed for exports, email batch |
| `exceljs@4.4.0` | XLSX export | Export still server-side for large files |
| `jspdf@2.5.2` | PDF export | Export still server-side |
| `nodemailer@7.0.13` | Email service | Server-side only |
| All `@radix-ui/*` | UI primitives | shadcn/ui foundation — retained |
| `tailwindcss@3.4.11` | Styling | Styling layer unchanged |
| `lucide-react@0.441.0` | Icons | UI unchanged |
| `sonner@1.5.0` | Toast notifications | UI unchanged |
| `@copilotkit/*` | AI integration | NL query feature — can target DuckDB SQL |
| `@mastra/core@1.4.0` | AI agent | Retained |
| `date-fns@3.6.0` | Date utilities | Utility — retained |
| `lodash@4.17.21` | General utilities | Utility — retained |

### 2.4 Current Data Flow (Being Transformed)

#### 2.4.1 SQL Editor Flow (Current)
```
User types SQL → POST /api/sql/execute → Server validates → Server executes via Knex →
JSON response (max 500 rows) → Client renders in QueryResults (virtual scroll)
```

**Problem**: 500 row page limit, server round trip for every page/filter change.

#### 2.4.2 Report Viewing Flow (Current)
```
User opens report → GET /api/reports/[id] → Fetch saved query → Execute query server-side →
Apply filter-to-SQL → Return JSON (max 1000 rows) → DataTable with pagination
```

**Problem**: Server-side pagination means user must paginate to see more data; filtering requires re-execution.

#### 2.4.3 Chart Rendering Flow (Current)
```
Chart definition loaded → Fetch saved query → Execute query → Return JSON data →
Recharts SVG rendering → User interaction requires re-query
```

**Problem**: SVG performance limits, no drill-down without server calls, limited chart types.

#### 2.4.4 Dashboard Widget Flow (Current)
```
Dashboard loaded → Fetch all widgets → For each widget: fetch chart/report data via API →
Render independently → No cross-widget filtering
```

**Problem**: N+1 API calls, no linked filtering between widgets.

## 3. Target Architecture Overview

### 3.1 New Data Flow

```
[Server/Data Source]
       ↓
  Export to Parquet/Arrow IPC
       ↓
  HTTP Transfer (static files or streaming)
       ↓
[Browser: DuckDB-Wasm]
  ├── Load Parquet/Arrow into DuckDB tables
  ├── SQL queries execute locally (instant)
  ├── Filter/Sort/Aggregate/Window functions
  ├── Results as Arrow RecordBatch
  ↓
[Rendering Layer]
  ├── Glide Data Grid (canvas-based table)
  ├── Apache ECharts (canvas-based charts)
  └── Dashboard composition
```

### 3.2 Hybrid Architecture

The system will operate in a **hybrid mode**:

**Client-Side (DuckDB-Wasm):**
- All analytical queries (SELECT, filtering, aggregation, sorting, window functions)
- SQL editor execution (against loaded datasets)
- Chart data computation
- Report data computation
- Cross-widget dashboard filtering
- Schema browsing (of loaded datasets)

**Server-Side (Retained):**
- Authentication and session management
- RBAC and permission checks
- Configuration database (users, roles, reports, charts, dashboards definitions)
- Data source management (connection configs, encryption)
- Data export pipeline (Parquet/Arrow file generation from source databases)
- Background jobs (email batch, scheduled exports)
- Audit logging
- NL query AI processing (SQL generation — execution moves to client)

### 3.3 Data Pipeline

```
Source Database (pg/mysql/mssql/sqlite/oracle)
       ↓
[Server] Data Export Service
  ├── Knex.js reads from source database
  ├── Converts to Arrow RecordBatch
  ├── Writes as Parquet file (compressed)
  ├── Stores in /data/exports/ (or cloud storage)
  └── Exposes via HTTP endpoint
       ↓
[Client] DuckDB-Wasm Data Loader
  ├── Fetches Parquet file via HTTP
  ├── Registers as DuckDB table
  ├── Caches in IndexedDB for offline
  └── Ready for SQL queries
```

    ↓
[Client] DuckDB-Wasm executes query locally
    ↓
Results as Arrow RecordBatch
    ↓
Glide Data Grid renders (canvas, smooth scroll)
    ↓
User filters/sorts → DuckDB re-executes → instant re-render
```

**Key changes:**
- No server round trip for query execution
- No 500-row page limit — DuckDB handles full results
- Filtering/sorting is instant (local SQL re-execution)
- Schema browser reads from DuckDB `information_schema`

### 6.2 Report Viewing Flow (New)

```
User opens report
    ↓
Fetch report definition (metadata from config DB)
    ↓
Fetch associated dataset (Parquet from server)
    ↓
Load into DuckDB-Wasm
    ↓
Apply report's saved SQL + filter config → DuckDB executes locally
    ↓
Glide Data Grid renders full results
    ↓
User applies filters → DuckDB re-executes → instant re-render
User sorts → DuckDB ORDER BY → instant re-render
User aggregates → DuckDB GROUP BY → instant re-render
```

### 6.3 Chart Rendering Flow (New)

```
Chart definition loaded (config from server)
    ↓
Dataset loaded into DuckDB-Wasm (if not already cached)
    ↓
Chart SQL query executes locally in DuckDB
    ↓
Results → Apache ECharts option object
    ↓
ECharts renders (canvas, progressive for large datasets)
    ↓
User interacts (zoom, brush, drill-down) → DuckDB re-query → instant re-render
```

### 6.4 Dashboard Flow (New)

```
Dashboard loaded
    ↓
Load all required datasets into DuckDB-Wasm (deduplicated)
    ↓
Each widget queries DuckDB locally
    ↓
Cross-widget filter manager:
  User clicks chart element in Widget A
    → CrossFilterManager propagates filter condition
    → All linked widgets re-query DuckDB with new WHERE clause
    → All widgets re-render instantly
```

### 6.5 Data Ingestion Flow (New)

```
Admin configures data source (unchanged)
    ↓
Admin triggers "Prepare Dataset" for a query/table
    ↓
Server executes query against source database (Knex.js)
    ↓
Server converts results to Parquet (with Arrow intermediate)
    ↓
Parquet file stored on server with metadata (schema, row count, size, timestamp)
    ↓
Client requests dataset → HTTP GET → Parquet file streamed to browser
    ↓
DuckDB-Wasm loads Parquet → cached in IndexedDB
    ↓
Subsequent loads use cache if not stale
```

## 9. Migration Constraints

### 9.1 Database Schema

- **No changes** to the configuration database schema (users, roles, reports, charts, dashboards, etc.)
- The `connection_config` encryption system remains unchanged
- Migration scripts are NOT needed for the config DB
- New server-side tables MAY be needed for:
  - `dataset_cache_registry` — tracks generated Parquet files
  - `dataset_refresh_schedule` — scheduled data exports

### 9.2 API Compatibility

- All `/api/admin/*` routes remain unchanged
- All `/api/auth/*` routes remain unchanged
- All `/api/data-sources/*` routes remain unchanged (enhanced with Parquet export)
- All `/api/jobs/*` routes remain unchanged
- All `/api/email-templates/*` routes remain unchanged
- All `/api/notifications/*` routes remain unchanged
- All `/api/settings/*` routes remain unchanged
- `/api/sql/execute` — **Enhanced**: add Parquet/Arrow output format option
- `/api/queries/[id]/execute` — **Enhanced**: add Parquet/Arrow output format option
- `/api/reports/[id]/data` — **New**: return Parquet for client-side rendering
- `/api/charts/[id]/data` — **New**: return Parquet for client-side rendering
- **New API routes**:
  - `api/datasets/` — Dataset management (list, generate, status, download)
  - `api/datasets/[id]/parquet` — Stream Parquet file
  - `api/datasets/[id]/arrow` — Stream Arrow IPC

### 9.3 Configuration Preservation

- All existing `chart_config` JSON (Recharts format) SHALL be supported via a compatibility adapter
- All existing `data_mapping` JSON SHALL be transformed to ECharts format
- All existing `filter_config` JSON SHALL work with both server and client execution
- All existing `layout_config` JSON for dashboards SHALL work without changes

### 9.4 Phased Migration

The refactoring MUST be done in phases to maintain a working system throughout:

1. **Phase 1**: Infrastructure (DuckDB-Wasm provider, Parquet API, Arrow transport)
2. **Phase 2**: Table replacement (Glide Data Grid for SQL editor + reports)
3. **Phase 3**: Chart replacement (ECharts for all chart types + new types)
4. **Phase 4**: Dashboard integration (cross-filtering, shared datasets)
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced features (offline, progressive loading, 3D charts)

## 10. Risk Assessment

### 10.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| DuckDB-Wasm memory limits on low-RAM devices | High | Medium | Memory monitoring, dataset size warnings, server fallback |
| SharedArrayBuffer requirement limits browser compat | Medium | Low | COOP/COEP headers, fallback to single-threaded mode |
| Parquet file generation adds server complexity | Medium | Medium | Use established libraries (parquet-wasm, arrow-js) |
| ECharts bundle size increase | Low | High | Tree-shaking, lazy loading chart types on demand |
| Glide Data Grid learning curve | Low | Medium | Good documentation, similar API patterns |
| DuckDB SQL dialect differences from source DBs | Medium | Medium | Adapter layer for query translation |
| IndexedDB storage limits (Safari ~1GB) | Medium | Low | Storage quota monitoring, LRU eviction |

### 10.2 Project Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Large scope — many components to replace | High | High | Phased approach, maintain old components as fallback |
| Breaking changes to chart config format | High | Medium | Compatibility adapter for Recharts→ECharts config |
| Performance regression during transition | Medium | Medium | Feature flags to toggle old/new components |
| Increased initial load time (WASM download) | Medium | Medium | Lazy load DuckDB-Wasm, CDN hosting |

## 11. Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **NOT** part of this refactoring:

1. **Authentication/Authorization changes** — NextAuth v5 + RBAC stays as-is
2. **Database schema changes** for the config DB — schema preserved
3. **Docker/deployment changes** — may need COOP/COEP header config in Nginx
4. **UI framework change** — Next.js 14, shadcn/ui, Tailwind stay as-is
5. **Background job system changes** — BullMQ + Redis stays as-is
6. **Email system changes** — Nodemailer stays as-is
7. **AI/NL query model changes** — OpenAI/CopilotKit stays (execution moves to client)
8. **Admin pages** — User/Role/Permission management pages stay as-is
9. **React upgrade** — Staying on React 18

## 12. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **DuckDB-Wasm** | In-browser analytical SQL database compiled to WebAssembly; runs SQL locally without a server |
| **Glide Data Grid** | Canvas-based React data grid that renders cells on HTML5 Canvas instead of DOM elements |
| **Apache ECharts** | JavaScript charting library using Canvas/SVG rendering with 40+ chart types |
| **Apache Arrow** | Columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data; enables zero-copy data sharing |
| **Parquet** | Columnar file format optimized for analytics; supports compression and predicate pushdown |
| **Arrow IPC** | Arrow's Inter-Process Communication format for streaming columnar data |
| **COOP/COEP** | Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy / Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy — HTTP headers required for SharedArrayBuffer |
| **SharedArrayBuffer** | JavaScript API for shared memory between threads; required for DuckDB-Wasm multi-threading |
| **Progressive Rendering** | Rendering technique that shows partial results immediately, completing over time |
| **Cross-Widget Filtering** | Dashboard feature where interacting with one widget filters data in all linked widgets |
| **Predicate Pushdown** | Optimization that applies filter conditions during data loading rather than after |
