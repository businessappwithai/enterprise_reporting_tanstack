// also runs in the browser, and Vite does not put process.env in the client bundle. The flags
// were therefore always false in the browser while the server render saw them set — a
// hydration mismatch, and no way to switch on anything they gate (the Datasets page said
// "WASM mode is not enabled" with NEXT_PUBLIC_WASM_ENABLED=true). Substituting the five flags
// at build time, in the client and server bundles alike, makes both read the same value: the
// one in the environment (or .env) when `vite dev` / `vite build` runs, so a Docker build
// needs them as build arguments. Only the flags are substituted: other NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables
// are read by the server at run time and must stay that way.
