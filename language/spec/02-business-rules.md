# EML — Business Rules (Decision Flows)

A **business rule** in EML is a directed **decision flow**: a `flowchart` whose
**node shapes** encode decision roles and whose **edge labels** carry branch
conditions. The generator compiles it to a **GoRules JDM** decision graph via
`packages/web/src/lib/mermaid-flowchart-parser.ts` →
`packages/web/src/lib/jdm-converter.ts`.

Use business rules for declarative logic: pricing, discounts, eligibility,
validation, approval routing, scoring.

## Marking a flow as rules

Precede the flowchart with:

```
%%meta kind: rules
```

Absent the marker, a flow with only decision/expression/function/io shapes and
no `%%hook` directives is still treated as rules; otherwise it is a workflow.

## Node shapes → JDM roles

| Mermaid shape | Syntax | JDM role | Meaning |
|---------------|--------|----------|---------|
| Stadium | `A([label])` | `inputNode` / `outputNode` | Start / input context, or End / output. **Output** when it has only incoming edges; otherwise **input**. |
| Diamond | `B{label}` | `switchNode` | Decision / branch. Outgoing edge labels are the branch conditions. |
| Circle | `C((label))` | `functionNode` | Custom function / computation (JS expression or reusable function). |
| Rounded | `D(label)` | `functionNode` | Computation step (e.g. "Calculate Final Price"). |
| Rectangle | `E[label]` | `expressionNode` | Expression / assignment / action (set outputs, apply a value). |

The single stadium shape marks **both** Start and End: a terminal node with only
incoming edges is the decision output, so `A([Start ...])` and `H([End ...])`
resolve to input and output respectively.

## Edges and conditions

```
<SourceId> -->|<label>| <TargetId>
```

- On edges leaving a **decision** (diamond), the label is the **branch
  condition** (`Yes`, `No`, `amount > 1000`, `tier == "gold"`).
- On other edges the label is an optional transition name.
- An unlabeled edge (`C --> G`) is a plain transition.

## Complete rule example — order pricing

```mermaid
%%meta name: Order Pricing
%%meta kind: rules
%%rule pricing on Order event: beforeCreate priority: 10
flowchart TD
    A([Start: Order Received]) --> B{Order Amount > 1000?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Apply Premium Discount 15%]
    B -->|No| D{Customer is VIP?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Apply VIP Discount 10%]
    D -->|No| F[Apply Standard Pricing]
    C --> G(Calculate Final Price)
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H([End: Price Calculated])
```

Compiles to a JDM graph:

- `A` → `inputNode` (Start)
- `B`, `D` → `switchNode` (decisions)
- `C`, `E`, `F` → `expressionNode` (apply discount / pricing)
- `G` → `functionNode` (calculate)
- `H` → `outputNode` (End)

Each edge becomes a JDM edge; labeled decision edges (`Yes`/`No`) become the
branch conditions of their switch node.

## Another example — shipping eligibility

```mermaid
%%meta name: Free Shipping Eligibility
%%meta kind: rules
%%rule freeShipping on Order event: beforeUpdate priority: 20
flowchart TD
    S([Start]) --> Q1{Subtotal >= 50?}
    Q1 -->|No| P1[Charge Standard Shipping]
    Q1 -->|Yes| Q2{Member Tier == gold?}
    Q2 -->|Yes| P2[Free Express Shipping]
    Q2 -->|No| P3[Free Standard Shipping]
    P1 --> R((Compute Shipping Cost))
    P2 --> R
    P3 --> R
    R --> E([End])
```

## Action directives — rule side-effects

A plain decision flow (as above) compiles to a node-graph JDM that can only
**decide** — it carries no outputs, so the rules engine finds nothing to act
on. To let a rule **act** (reject a write, stamp a field, or trigger a
`kind: saga` workflow), declare one or more `%%action` directives in the same
section instead of drawing the decision as nodes:

```
%%action <name> <actionType> when: <expr> <key>: <value> ...
```

A section carrying `%%action` directives compiles to a GoRules **decision
table** — one row per directive, `hitPolicy: collect` so more than one can
match a single write — rather than the node-graph shape a plain flow produces.
`when` is a zen expression over the record being written (`true` fires on
every write).

```mermaid
%%meta name: Deviation Escalation
%%meta kind: rules
%%rule deviationEscalation on DeviationReport event: beforeUpdate priority: 10
flowchart TD
    %%action escalate trigger-workflow when: severity == "critical" workflow: CriticalDeviationEscalation
    %%action requireCause validation-error when: status == "closed" and root_cause == null message: A closed deviation needs a root cause
```

The three action types — `trigger-workflow`, `validation-error`, `transform` —
and their keys are in
[`05-directives.md`](05-directives.md#action--rule-side-effect-shipped).
`trigger-workflow` is how a rule reaches a `kind: saga` workflow declared with
`trigger: rule`: the rule's `when` decides, and the action names the workflow.

## Authoring guidance

- Give every flow exactly one Start stadium and at least one End stadium.
- Keep decision labels short and machine-parseable (`Yes`/`No`, or a comparison).
- Prefer expression nodes for "set/apply" actions and function nodes for
  "compute" steps — the distinction maps to JDM `expressionNode` vs
  `functionNode`.
- Bind the rule to an entity + lifecycle event with `%%rule` so the generator
  knows when to evaluate it.
