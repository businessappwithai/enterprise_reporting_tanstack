/**
 * Load a generated application into the reporting platform.
 *
 * Runs once, after both databases are up, and leaves the reporting platform
 * holding a working analytics workspace for whatever application was just
 * generated:
 *
 *   1. the generated application's database, registered as a data source with
 *      its connection details encrypted the way the platform expects
 *   2. that database's schema, introspected and cached — which is what the
 *      NL-query pipeline reads as context, and what the data-source screens
 *      list as entities
 *   3. every saved query, report, chart, dashboard and widget in the reporting
 *      pack derived from the model
 *
 * It is idempotent by name: run it twice and the second run updates in place.
 * That matters because it runs on every `docker compose up`, not only the first.
 *
 * ## Why it lives in this repository
 *
 * It was written in `app-and-report-with-ai-tanstack`, where docker-compose
 * stands this platform up beside a generated application, and it was *copied
 * into this tree at image build time* so that it could import through `@/`.
 * That is the right dependency and the wrong direction: the file needs this
 * project's real `getDb`, `encrypt` and `introspectAndCacheSchema` — a seeder
 * with its own encryption or its own schema-cache shape drifts from the reader,
 * and the failure looks like a data source that exists and cannot be opened —
 * and it writes eleven of this schema's tables, so it belongs beside them.
 *
 * It is checked in here now because there is a third caller. A generated
 * application's own `docker-compose.yml` brings this platform up alongside it
 * (`reporting/` in the generated project), and a copy of an 800-line seeder in
 * the code generator's templates would be the third implementation of the same
 * writes. Every caller runs *this* file:
 *
 *   docker run … enterprise-reporting bun scripts/seed-reporting-pack.ts
 *
 * with `REPORTING_PACK` naming the pack and `APP_DATABASE_URL` the application
 * database to register.
 *
 * ## What a pack is
 *
 * A JSON document derived from the model the application was generated from, by
 * `buildReportingPack` in `app-with-ai-tanstack`'s generator
 * (`packages/generator/src/reporting/pack.ts`). Nothing in it is invented:
 * every query comes from something the model declares, and every role mirrors
 * a `%%rbac` role's `read` rules. This file only writes it down.

 * user tables, in separate databases, behind separate sign-in screens, and a
 * role means a different thing on each side: in the application it decides what
 * a user may do to a record, here it decides which tables their queries and
 * reports may read. The names line up so an administrator can tell which is
 * which; nothing else is shared, and neither password works on the other.
 *
 * The addresses are deliberately different for the same reason — the reporting
 * account for `sales_manager` is `sales.manager@<app>.reports.example.com`,
 * against the application's `sales.manager@<app>.example.com`. Identical
 * addresses would invite a reader to try one password on both.
 *
 * Idempotent by email and by name, like everything else here: it runs on every
 * `docker compose up`, not only the first.
 *
 * Two things are seeded per role, and they are different layers:
 *
 *   - a platform user + role + link, which is what signing in produces;
 *   - a `ds_role` scoped to this data source, with one `ds_entity_permissions`
 *     row per table the role may read. That is the part derived from `%%rbac`.
